# DEBRISENSE PROJECT - QUICK SUMMARY

## What It Is 
DebriSense is a web-based dashboard that predicts debris accumulation in Malaysian rivers using a *Debris Risk Index (DRI)* - a weighted index system modeled after Malaysia's Department of Environment (DOE) Water Quality Index (WQI).

**Important:** This system does NOT use machine learning or AI. It uses a transparent, rule-based weighted index calculation similar to DOE's established WQI methodology.

## The Problem
- Malaysian rivers heavily polluted with debris (68.2% plastic in Sungai Kelantan, 11,600 kg/day in Klang River)
- Existing systems only monitor water quality (chemical parameters), not debris
- Current approaches are reactive, not predictive 
- No integration between weather, sensors, and debris forecasting

## The Solution
A predictive dashboard using **weighted index methodology** (NOT machine learning):
- DebriSense uses a weighted index calculation system modeled after Malaysia's Department of Environment (DOE)
  Water Quality Index (WQI) methodology - it is NOT machine learning. The system collects four environmental 
  parameters: rainfall (mm), wind speed (kph), tide level (m), and water flow rate (m³/s) from real-time weather APIs and
   simulated IoT sensors. Each parameter is first normalized to a 0-100 scale by dividing the current value by its maximum
    threshold (e.g., rainfall/50mm × 100), similar to how DOE calculates sub-indices for water quality parameters. 
    These normalized values are then multiplied by scientifically-determined weights based on literature review: rainfall 
    gets 40% weight (primary driver of urban debris runoff), wind speed 25% (secondary debris movement factor), 
    tide level 20% (tidal distribution influence), and water flow 15% (transport capacity). The weighted sum produces a 
    DRI score from 0-100, which is classified into risk levels: Very Low (0-30), Low (30-50), Medium (50-70), High (70-85), 
    or Critical (85-100). The system also estimates debris amount in kg/day by scaling the DRI score proportionally 
    to the Klang River baseline study (11,600 kg/day at DRI 70). For future predictions (6h, 12h, 24h), 
    the system applies the same DRI calculation but uses weather forecast data and applies adjustment factors 
    based on predicted rainfall changes, making it a transparent, rule-based predictive system rather than a black-box AI model. 
- Shows real-time environmental data on interactive map
- Color-coded risk levels (Very Low → Critical) 
- Enables proactive river management through rule-based risk assessment

## Debris Risk Index (DRI) Methodology
**Inspired by DOE Malaysia's Water Quality Index (WQI)**

- Algorithm: Weighted Index System
- Input factors with weights:
  - Rainfall: 40% (primary factor - urban runoff, stormwater transport)
  - Wind Speed: 25% (secondary factor - wind-driven debris movement)
  - Tide Level: 20% (tertiary factor - tidal influence on debris)
  - Water Flow: 15% (supporting factor - transport capacity)
- Each factor normalized to 0-100 scale
- DRI score calculated as weighted sum
- Risk classification: Very Low (0-30), Low (30-50), Medium (50-70), High (70-85), Critical (85-100)
- Estimated debris output in kg/day based on Klang River baseline (11,600 kg/day at DRI 70)

## Prediction Methodology
**NOT Machine Learning - Uses Rule-Based Weighted Index**

1. Extract current environmental factors from sensors and weather
2. Normalize each factor to 0-100 scale
3. Calculate weighted DRI score
4. For future predictions (6h, 12h, 24h):
   - Analyze weather forecast
   - Apply adjustment factor based on predicted conditions
   - Recalculate DRI with forecast data
5. Classify risk level based on DRI thresholds
6. Estimate debris amount (kg/day) proportional to DRI score

**Advantages of DRI approach:**
- ✅ Transparent and explainable methodology
- ✅ Based on established DOE WQI principles
- ✅ Scientifically defensible with literature-backed weights
- ✅ Deterministic calculations (high confidence)
- ✅ No reliance on training data unavailable in Malaysia
- ✅ Easy to adjust weights based on domain expert input

## Important Notes - Methodology Clarification
- ⚠️ **DOES NOT USE MACHINE LEARNING OR AI** - Uses transparent weighted index system
- **DRI methodology directly inspired by DOE Malaysia's Water Quality Index (WQI)**
- Scientifically defensible rule-based calculations with literature-backed weights
- Uses SIMULATED sensor data (not real IoT sensors yet)
- CSV-based storage (prototype phase)
- Requires internet for Weather API
- Designed as proof-of-concept/demonstration system 
- Weights (Rainfall 40%, Wind 25%, Tide 20%, Flow 15%) based on environmental research or can change, now this will be the value I come up with.  
- All calculations are transparent and explainable (not "black box" predictions)
