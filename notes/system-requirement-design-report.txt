REFERENCES
The list of references is closely tied to the review of the state of the art given in section 3. Most examiners scan your list of references looking for the important works in the field, so make sure they are listed and referred in the report. 
All references given must be referred to in the main body of the report. Note the difference from a Bibliography, which may include works that are not directly referenced in the report. Organize the list of references either alphabetically by author surname (preferred), or by order of citation in the report.
List down all the references from books, journals, proceedings, websites, manual etc. Recommended reference style: APA or Harvard or IEEE.

APPENDICES
What goes in the appendices? Any material which impedes the smooth development of your presentation, but which is important to justify the results of a report. Generally, it is a material that is of too nitty-gritty a level of detail for inclusion in the main body of the report, but which should be available for perusal by the examiners to convince them sufficiently. Examples include program listings, immense tables of data, lengthy mathematical proofs or derivations, etc.
Include in the appendices reference materials that are too lengthy for the main report. If the appendix includes tables and figures, label them as Table A.1, Figure A.1, and so on.
